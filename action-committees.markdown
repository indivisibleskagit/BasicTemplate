Indivisible Skagit has action committees working to target specific resistance areas with laser focus. These groups report out to the larger group when action is required. We recommend finding a topic that you are passionate about and joining the group.

Many of our groups have leaders that can be contacted through the Indivisible Skagit email. The following groups can be reached at indivisibleskagit@gmail.com
