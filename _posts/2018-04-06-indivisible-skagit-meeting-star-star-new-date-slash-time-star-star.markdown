Deep Canvassing is a powerful tool for local organizing that can be used either to engage voters in conversation about the issues most impacting them and their families, or to engage in dialogue about a specific issue that enables voters to change their own mind. Join us to learn more about how Indivisible Skagit might employ this tool to strengthen our community and our cross-political relationships.
