The Social Security and Medicare group is co-sponsoring an evening of education and political action on Social Security with PSARA (Puget Sound Advocates for Retirement Action). It will be held Wednesday, May 17 from 6:30 to 8:00 at the Burlington Public Library. PSARA will present information on the history of social security, how it can be saved for current and future generations and political action steps we can take to protect this incredible resource. This presentation may be the first in a series and is directed not only at current beneficiaries but those who are concerned about Social Security and Medicare for the future.
