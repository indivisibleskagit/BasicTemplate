On April 3rd, Indivisible Skagit members Susan Bloomfield and Christine Kohnert met with a group referred to as the Coalition of Indivisible Groups-WA 1st and 2nd Congressional Districts. It includes various Indivisible and other resistance groups from Whatcom, Skagit and Snohomish Counties and Whidbey Island.

These almost monthly meetings with staff of our US Senators and Congressional Representatives have been going on for about a year. We have agreed to continue with monthly meetings and are hopeful that the 2nd Thursday of the month will be agreeable to all. The format will include 1 primary and possibly 2 other topics that will be decided by the participants about 2 weeks prior to the scheduled meeting. Normally the selected topic reflects an item from the Indivisible National agenda or sometimes a more immediate crisis.

The format for each topic will include 1) An ask-specifically what action do we want or legislator to take, 2) Support with concerns that include a story or testimony about the impact on our community and 3) Time for discussion. The group members take turns presenting and will work from their own loose format or outline. A copy of the agenda will be submitted to staff a week before the meeting.

We find out how our legislators feel about issues and what they are doing about it. Sometimes staff will promise to look into the issue, or they give additional information on a subject that we have not received from other sources. We plan to include a brief summary of these meetings in future newsletters. Please note that your emails, calls, postcards and letters are still very important to our legislators for each issue. They continue to tally how many individual constituents are in favor or against an issue. Often when we ask what more we can do to help, they tell us to keep calling and writing.
