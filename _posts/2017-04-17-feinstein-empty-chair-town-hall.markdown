The Tesoro Anacortes Refinery has proposed a project to produce and export xylenes â€” a toxic, flammable oil product. The proposal's draft environmental impact statement (EIS) is open for comment through May 8th. Please join us at an upcoming comment workshop and hearing.

-Public hearing and open house: 4:30 PM - 8:00 PM, Monday, April 17th, Anacortes High School, 1600 20th St, Anacortes

If you can't make it to the hearing, but you would like to submit a comment, please email cleanenergy@re-sources.org.

Tesoro's proposal will mean more tanker traffic through sensitive marine habitat in the Salish Sea, an increased risk of toxic spills, a rise in air pollution, and the continued threat of explosive oil trains running through our communities.
