Join our coalition between Skagit and Whatcom Indivisible groups at Maritime Heritage Park in Bellingham for a celebration of community action. You'll meet representatives from many local advocacy, environmental, political, service, and action groups, and enjoy networking with other local activists. We've got music and a poetry making activity as well! We'll also be kicking off a community art project for kids to participate in.
