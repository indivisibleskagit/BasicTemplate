# Indivisible Skagit Mission Statement

Act as a nexus to engage our members with opportunities to take collective action based on their values;

Practice horizontal and egalitarian leadership that invites active participation of the full diversity of our community;

Build one community, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all, and resist policies and legislation that harm that community.


# Indivisible Skagit Support Team

The Indivisible Skagit (IndiSkagit) Support Team is a locally based, horizontally self-organized group of concerned, action-oriented members.

The Support Team is an organizational support for our workgroups or action teams. The Support Team has no authority over IndiSkagit action teams.

The Support Team has assumed responsibility for the website, e-newsletter, Facebook Group, and Facebook page. We schedule and plan the monthly meetings. One or more Support Team members participate in monthly regional Indivisible meetings with staff from our members of Congress. We provide organizing and leadership support to the IndiSkagit action teams at their request. 

Occasionally, IndiSkagit receives requests from other progressive groups to sign letters of support or endorse a particular action campaign. The Support Team refers the request to the relevant action team, posts these requests on the Facebook Group to enable timely member response, and makes a decision based on the response and suggestions of our members, the action team, and/or the Support Team.

Anyone may join the Support Team, send requests or suggestions, and attend Support Team meetings. Decisions are made by consensus among those participating. Meetings are announced in advance on the FB Group, e-newsletter, and our website.
