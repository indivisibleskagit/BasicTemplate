On March 23, Secretary of the Interior Zinke announced at the National Park Service Office  in Sedro Woolley that the department would consider relocation of grizzly bears to the North Cascades to aid their recovery.  65 or more people showed up on a rainy morning with signs supporting a wide variety of public lands issues on less than a day's notice of the Secretary's visit.  Soon after this announcement, the public learned that Sec. Zinke's proposal to greatly raise admission fees to national parks was withdrawn.
