Effective Solutions That are Easy to Use:

“Good governance is a clash of ideas and values in the political arena. We need to listen to our opponent’s arguments and look for areas of common interest . . . if we are to govern this country effectively.” Brint Milward, National Institute for Civil Discourse

Join us for an public meeting on Civil Discourse in Skagit County — whose job is it, and how does it affect our community? We’ll hear from educational representatives, community organizations, the media and political representatives. Then, participation from the attendees — what’s important about the idea of Civil Discourse for Skagit County?

Please check the Calendar page for dates and times of upcoming workshops over the next few months.
