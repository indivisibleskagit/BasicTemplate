On March 24, 2018 students from High Schools in Mt. Vernon, Burlington, Sedro Woolley, and Anacortes  let a march of several hundred people from Mt. Vernon High School to the Skagit County Court House. There were many heart-felt signs and speeches, such as "I should be writing my college application essay, not my Will," or "My Mom should be crying because I'm going away to college, not because I was killed."
